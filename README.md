## Description
In flashlight mode, user taps screen to turn flashlight "On" or "Off." In colors mode, user taps screen to generate new random color, which is accompanied by the color's hexidecimal code. Generator seems to return a disproportionate amount of green and pink. I have yet to investigate why that may be the case.
